The Industrial Input / Output (IIO) framework has been
in the upstream Linux kernels since 2011, and is responsi-
ble for handling sensors, converters, integrated transceivers
and  other  real-world  I/O  devices.   It  provides  a  hardware
abstraction layer with a consistent API for the user space
applications.  The  IIO  framework supports discrete components as well as integrated transceivers
like the Analog Devices AD9361, a 2 x 2 RF Agile Transceiver,
found in many SDR products.

gr-iio contains several new
blocks for GNU Radio that can be used to stream samples
from and to high-speed IIO devices. These new GNU Radio blocks are built around ADIâ€™s libiio3
library,  which  concentrates  most  of  the  complexity,
supports all IIO devices and has built-in support for  data
streaming over the network.
This  data  streaming  feature  has  several  benefits:
it  allows  the  GNU  Radio  flowgraphs  to  run  on  operating  
systems other than Linux (including Windows),  and on more
capable computers than the development board where the
IIO devices are attached,  which is usually not suitable for
high-performance and real-time data processing.
